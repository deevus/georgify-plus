## About 

Georgify Plus! is an updated version of the [Georgify](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/georgify/ofjfdfaleomlfanfehgblppafkijjhmi) 
that aims to further improve the experience that the original Chrome Extension provided. I have been personally using Georgify since 2013 and
always wished it had a dark mode. [I reached out to the original developer on Twitter in 2022](https://twitter.com/deevus/status/1507628904512917504?s=20)
but had no response. 

From there I decided to "fork" the extension into Georgify Plus!.

## F.A.Q.

### Why does Hacker News flash white before enabling dark mode?

If you are using the forced dark mode instead of system setting, there will be a momentary flash of the light mode before the dark mode styles are loaded. 
For best performance, use the system setting. 

### Why is it called Georgify Plus!?

The `Plus!` suffix is an homage to [Microsoft Plus!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Plus!).
